    <b>Flamingo.py</b>
    <br>
    <p>First I need to explain few things.
        <q>What is <i>flamingo.py?</i>Why did you make it?</q>
        that's what you are probably thinking.<br/>
        <i>flamingo</i> is a test project for a library called <i>Tkinter</i>.<br/>
        It's called <i>flamingo.py</i> because it has a flamingo in it. (heh)<br/>
        I made it to learn how to use <i>Tkinter</i> so <i>it's just some basic stuff</i>.<br/>
        So let's get to the code shall we?<br/>
    
        <q>wait wait wait but how to install tkinter bro?</q><br/>
    
        ...<br/>
        o yeah i forgot about that<br/>
        as its states on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">tkinter documentation</a><br/>
    
        >*The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.*<br/>
        >*Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems.*<br/>
        >*(Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)*<br/>
    
        in other words you should have it installed already with python<br/>
        After getting that out of the way let's just get straight to code<br/>
    
        ```python
        from tkinter import * 
        ```
        - You need to import tkinter library<br/>
        ```python
        a = Tk()
        a.geometry("400x400")
        ```
        - *a.geometry("400x400")* is for the window size<br/>
        ```python
        a.resizable(width=False, height=False)
        a.configure(bg="pink", cursor="heart")
        ```
        Some settings for the window <br/>
        - *a.resizable(width=False, height=False)* is for disabling an option for user to risize the window<br/>
        - *a.configure(bg="pink", cursor="heart")* changes background to pink (*(bg="pink",*) and changes the cursor look (*cursor="heart")*)
        ```python
        img = PhotoImage(file="flamingo.png")
        ```
        - Here you need an image file called flamingo.png<br/>
        - If you are writing this code and you want flamingo.png you can get it from [here](https://github.com/XMASTEr1432/python-code/blob/main/flamingo%20app/flamingo.png) <br/>
        ```python
        canvas = Canvas(a, width = 400, height = 400, bg = "pink",bd=0, highlightthickness=0,)
        ```
        - [The Canvas is a rectangular area intended for drawing pictures or other complex layouts. You can place graphics, text, widgets or frames on a Canvas.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/tk_canvas.htm)<br/>
        - Lets see what things we change<br/>
        - *(a,* is the *a = Tk()* command from ealier<br/>
        - *width = 400,* it changes the width of the image<br/>
        - *height = 400,* it changes the height of the image<br/>
        - *bg = "pink",* color of the background in the canvas<br/>
        - *bd = 0,* the border size<br/>
        ```python      
        canvas.pack()
        ```
        - Create the canvas<br/>
        ```python
        canvas.create_image(20,20,anchor=NW, image=img) 
        ```
        - Change the place where the canvas is created<br/>
        ```python
        a.title("flamingo") ## this changes the window title
        ```
        - Change the window title<br/>
        ```python 
        a.iconphoto(False, img)
        ```
        - Change the icon (*img* is a variable from earlier(*img = PhotoImage(file="flamingo.png")*))<br/>
        ```python 
        a.mainloop() ## you need this to have a window running
        ```
        - You need this to keep the window running<br/>
        ## That's it! You made it!
