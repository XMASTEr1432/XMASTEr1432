# **flamingo.py**
###### Woah you got here... cool<br/>
First I need to explain few things. <br/>
>What is *flamingo.py?* Why did you make it?

that's what you are probably thinking.<br/>
**flamingo.py** is a test project for a library called ***Tkinter***.<br/>
It's called *flamingo.py* because it has a flamingo in it. (heh)<br/>
I made it to learn how to use **Tkinter** so *it's just some basic stuff*.<br/>
So let's get to the code shall we?<br/>

>wait wait wait but how to install tkinter bro?<br/>

...<br/>
o yeah i forgot about that<br/>
as its states on [tkinter documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

>*The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.*<br/>
>*Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems.*<br/>
>*(Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)*<br/>

in other words you should have it installed already with python<br/>
After getting that out of the way let's just get straight to code

```python

```
